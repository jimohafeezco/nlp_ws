{"What is a novel coronavirus?": "A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the\u00a0coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans\u00a0and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\nA diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.", "Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?": "On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization\u00a0announced\u00a0an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u2018CO\u2019 stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 \u2018VI\u2019 for \u2018virus,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d.\nThere are many types\u00a0of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0best practiceexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0for naming of new human infectious diseases.", "Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?": "People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.\nStigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.\nStigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.", "How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?": "People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or\u00a0mental health\u00a0of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See\u00a0resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by\u00a0knowing the facts\u00a0and sharing them with others in your community.", "Why do some state\u2019s COVID-19 case numbers sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC\u2019s website?": "CDC\u2019s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.", "How do CDC\u2019s COVID-19 case numbers compare with those provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Johns Hopkins?": "CDC\u2019s COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.", "Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?": "Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as \u201cbackfill.\u201d) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.", "COVID-19 and Hypertension": "Are people with high blood pressure (hypertension) at higher risk from COVID-19?\nAt this time, we do not think that people with high blood pressure and no other underlying health conditions are more likely than others to get severely ill from COVID-19. Although many people who have gotten severely ill from COVID-19 have high blood pressure, they are often older or have other medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, and serious heart conditions that place them at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\nIf you have high blood pressure, it\u2019s critically important that you keep your blood pressure under control to lower your risk for heart disease and strokes. Take your blood pressure\u00a0medications\u00a0as directed, keep a log of your blood pressure every day if you are able to take your blood pressure at home, and work with your healthcare team to make sure your blood pressure is well controlled. Any changes to your medications should be made in consultation with your healthcare team.\nShould I continue to take my blood pressure medication?\nYes. Continue to take your blood pressure medications exactly as prescribed and make lifestyle modifications agreed upon in your treatment plan. Continue all your regular medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), as prescribed by your healthcare team. This is recommended by current clinical guidelines from the American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology", "What is the source of the virus?": "COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. \u00a0Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.\nMore information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.", "How does the virus spread?": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\nCOVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (\u201ccommunity spread\u201d) in\u00a0many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.\nLearn what is known about the\u00a0spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.", "Why are we seeing a rise in cases?": "The\u00a0number of cases of COVID-19\u00a0being reported in the United States is rising due to\u00a0increased laboratory testing\u00a0and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.", "Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is\u00a0spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.\nHow long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.\nLearn more about\u00a0CDC\u2019s guidance on when to release someone from isolation\u00a0and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see\u00a0Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.\nSomeone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.", "Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?": "Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.", "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?": "Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nIn general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.\nLearn what is known about the\u00a0spread of COVID-19.", "Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?": "Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food \u2013 additional investigation is needed.", "Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?": "It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.\u00a0 There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.", "What is community spread?": "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.", "What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?": "Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don\u2019t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow\u00a0CDC\u2019s guidance for cleaning and disinfection.", "Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?": "At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See\u00a0How Coronavirus Spreads\u00a0for more information.", "Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?": "This is a rapidly evolving situation and the\u00a0risk assessment\u00a0may change daily.

This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example). Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.", "Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?": "\n\nIt is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness.

The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\u00a0This type of spread is not a concern after death.\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nPeople should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community\u2019s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.

When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation.\nPutting mitigation into practice is based on:\n\nEmphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions\nEmpowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness\nFocusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness\nMinimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible\n\n*CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
